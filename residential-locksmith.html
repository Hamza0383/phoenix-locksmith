                We get there fast with lock picks and bypass tools. Most house
                lockouts take 5-15 minutes to open without damaging your door or
                lock.
              </p>
              <p><strong>What we do:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Arrive in 15-30 minutes (most Phoenix areas)</li>
                <li>Verify you live there (ID + mail with your address)</li>
                <li>
                  Pick the lock or use bypass methods (no drilling unless
                  necessary)
                </li>
                <li>Get you inside safely</li>
                <li>Check the lock works properly after opening</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Cost:</strong> $85-$150 for standard house lockout</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Available 24/7</strong> — including nights, weekends,
                holidays. Same pricing around the clock.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Locked out in extreme heat?</strong> Tell dispatch when
                you call. We prioritize calls where someone's stuck outside in

              <p>
                <strong
                  >Just moved into a house? Lost your keys? Need to cut off
                  access for someone?</strong

              </p>
              <p>
                Rekeying changes the lock so old keys stop working. We take
                apart your existing lock, rearrange the pins inside, and give
                you new keys. Original lock stays in place — cheaper than full
                replacement.
              </p>
              <p><strong>When to rekey:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Just bought or rented a house (previous owner/tenant had keys)
                </li>
                <li>Lost your keys somewhere</li>
                <li>Broke up and want ex's keys to stop working</li>
                <li>Employee/contractor had keys and shouldn't anymore</li>
                <li>Just want fresh keys for any reason</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                <strong>Process:</strong>
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>We arrive with rekeying equipment</li>
                <li>Remove lock cylinders from your doors</li>
                <li>
                  Change the pin configuration (takes 5-10 minutes per lock)
                </li>
                <li>Cut new keys on-site</li>
                <li>Test everything works</li>
                <li>Give you 2-3 copies of new keys</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                <strong>Time:</strong> About 10 minutes per lock. Typical house
                with 3 exterior doors takes 30-40 minutes total.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Cost:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>First lock: $85-$120</li>
                <li>Additional locks: $25-$35 each</li>
                <li>Example: 3 doors rekeyed = $135-$190</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                <strong>We can rekey most lock brands:</strong> Kwikset,

                Phoenix heat and dust are tough on locks. We fix common problems
                on-site:
              </p>

              <p><strong>Problems we repair:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Keys that stick or won't turn smoothly</li>
                <li>Locks that jam up</li>
                <li>Loose doorknobs or handles</li>
                <li>Misaligned strike plates (door has to be forced shut)</li>
                <li>Broken internal springs or pins</li>
                <li>Worn lock cylinders</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                <strong>Process:</strong> We disassemble the lock, identify the
                problem (worn pins, broken springs, dust buildup), replace
                broken parts, lubricate, and reassemble.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Time:</strong> 15-30 minutes for most repairs</p>
              <p><strong>Cost:</strong> $75-$140 depending on parts needed</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Sometimes replacement makes more sense:</strong> If your
                lock is very old or badly worn, replacing it might cost about
                the same as repairing it. We'll tell you both options and let
                you choose.

                <strong
                  >Have several doors and want one key that opens them
                  all?</strong

              </p>
              <p>
                Master key systems give you one key that works on multiple
                locks. Good for:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Large houses with many exterior doors</li>
                <li>Want one key for you, different keys for kids/guests</li>
                <li>
                  Rental properties (master key for landlord, individual keys
                  for tenants)
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                <strong>How it works:</strong> Each lock gets its own key that
                ONLY opens that lock. You get a master key that opens ALL the
                locks. Other people only get keys to their specific door.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Cost:</strong> Depends on number of doors, but typically
                $200-$400 for 4-6 door setup.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>We'll design the system</strong> based on which doors
                you want controlled by which keys.

          <p class="pt-1">
            <strong>Rekeying is usually cheaper and faster</strong> when your
            existing locks work fine.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Rekey when:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Locks are in good condition</li>
            <li>You like the current hardware style</li>
            <li>Just need to change who has access</li>
            <li>Want to save money</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Replace when:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Locks are old or damaged</li>
            <li>Want to upgrade to better locks</li>

          <div class="faq-grid">
            <!-- FAQ Item 1 -->
            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>How fast can you get to me if I'm locked out?</summary>
              <p>
                Most
                <a href="https://www.phoenix.gov/" target="_blank">Phoenix</a>
                neighborhoods: 15-30 minutes. Depends on where you are and where
                our closest van is when you call.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you call, dispatch will tell you the estimated arrival time
                to your specific address.
              </p>
            </details>

            <!-- FAQ Item 2 -->
            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>
                Can you get me into my house without breaking the lock?
              </summary>
              <p>
                Usually yes. We use lock picks and bypass tools that open the
                lock without damage. Works on most standard residential locks.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you have a high-security lock or the lock is damaged/jammed,
                we might need to drill it. We'll tell you before proceeding if
                that's necessary.
              </p>
            </details>

            <!-- FAQ Item 3 -->
            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>What do you need to prove I live there?</summary>
              <p>For lockouts, we need:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Photo ID (driver's license, state ID)</li>
                <li>
                  Something with your name and the address (utility bill, mail,
                  lease agreement, mortgage statement)
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This protects you from someone claiming they live in your house
                and getting us to open it for them.
              </p>
            </details>

            <!-- FAQ Item 4 -->
            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>
                Should I rekey or replace my locks after moving in?
              </summary>
              <p>
                <strong>Rekey is usually the right choice</strong> if the
                existing locks are in good condition. It's cheaper ($135-190 for
                3 doors) and you don't have to worry about who has old keys.
              </p>
              <p>
                Replace if the locks are old, damaged, or you want to upgrade to
                better locks.
              </p>
            </details>

            <!-- FAQ Item 5 -->
            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>How long does it take to rekey a house?</summary>
              <p>
                About 10 minutes per lock once we start working. A typical house
                with:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>1 door: 15-20 minutes total</li>
                <li>3 doors: 30-40 minutes total</li>
                <li>5 doors: 45-60 minutes total</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                We can usually do same-day rekeying if you call in the morning.
              </p>
            </details>

            <!-- FAQ Item 6 -->
            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>
                Can you install smart locks that work with my phone?
              </summary>
              <p>
                Yes. We install Schlage, Yale, Kwikset, August, and other smart
                lock brands. We'll mount the lock, program it, connect it to
                your phone, and show you how to use it.
              </p>
              <p>Typical installation takes 30-45 minutes per door.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>Do you provide keys with rekeying service?</summary>
              <p>
                Yes. We cut 2-3 keys for each lock we rekey (included in the
                price). Need more keys? We can cut additional copies for $5-10
                each.
              </p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>What if my lock breaks again after you fix it?</summary>
              <p>
                Our work comes with a 30-day warranty on labor. If a lock we
                repaired or installed stops working within 30 days (and you
                didn't damage it), we'll come back and fix it at no charge.
              </p>
              <p>
                Parts carry manufacturer warranties (usually 1-3 years depending
                on brand).
              </p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
              <summary>Can I get all my house keys on one key?</summary>
              <p>
                Only if you rekey all the locks to match each other. We can
                rekey every lock in your house to work with the same key — one
                key opens front door, back door, side door, garage door, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Cost:</strong> First lock $85-120, additional locks
                $25-35 each

          <h2 class="pt-1">Common Phoenix Home Lock Problems</h2>
          <h3 class="pt-1">Heat-Related Issues</h3>
          <p class="pt-1"><strong>Phoenix's extreme heat causes:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Metal expanding and locks getting tight</li>
            <li>Plastic smart lock components warping</li>
            <li>Door frames shifting (makes locks misalign)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Solution:</strong> Regular lubrication with graphite spray
            (not oil) helps. Misaligned locks need adjustment.
          </p>
          <h3 class="pt-1">Dust and Debris</h3>
          <p class="pt-1">
            <strong>Desert dust gets inside locks and causes:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Keys that stick</li>
            <li>Locks that feel gritty</li>
            <li>Mechanisms that jam</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Solution:</strong> Blow out dust with compressed air.
            Re-lubricate with graphite.
          </p>
          <h3 class="pt-1">Worn Out Locks</h3>
          <p class="pt-1">Daily use wears down pins and tumblers:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Key hard to insert or turn</li>
            <li>Lock feels loose</li>
            <li>Key wiggles excessively</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Solution:</strong> Usually needs rekeying or replacement
            depending on wear level.
